## What is this app about?

An app to prepare you for the (Virginia) DMV tests. I first started this app when I personally was practicing for the learner's permit test on Dec. 22, 2016, and got ALL correct on the exam!

The older version is [available on the App Store (search for `DMV A-Z`)](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1193281712), while this version will be released soon.

## Tips for taking the learner's permit Test

You SHOULD read the driver's manual CAREFULLY. Then you should try ALL the problems included in this app. 

You might want to pay more attentions on the following problems. A lot of my friends got wrong on them.

- 3.7 Backing and Parking, 1121
- 3.8 Dangerous Driving Behaviors, 1143

If you want more practices, we used a Kahoot game in our Drivers Education class as a review -- [Driver Education Review by NSWalsh](https://play.kahoot.it/#/k/5e087226-a672-426e-b561-59f7d9f237ef/intro).

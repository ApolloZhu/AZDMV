## Why do I want to use this app?

I was practicing for the knowledge exam to get my own learner's permit back in 2016, Dec. 22. I wrote this app and used it myself, and got ALL CORRECT on both parts of the exam. You can [download this app on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1193281712)

## Tips for taking the knowledge exam

In addition to using this app and practicing all the quizzes included, you SHOULD read the driver's manual CAREFULLY (which is also included in this app).

You might want to pay special attentions on the following quizzes. A lot of my friends told me they got these wrong:

- 3.7 Backing and Parking, 1121
- 3.8 Dangerous Driving Behaviors, 1143

And my drivers ed teacher put together a Kahoot game: [Driver Education Review by NSWalsh](https://play.kahoot.it/#/k/5e087226-a672-426e-b561-59f7d9f237ef/intro). As it says, it's a pretty good review.

## But...

All right. If you noticed a bug in my program, have a feature that you want to see in the app, or are concerned about something, please feel free to tell me by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/ApolloZhu/AZDMV/issues/new). However, it's just impossible for me to get everything done in a snap, so if you want to check on my progress, it's [here](https://github.com/ApolloZhu/AZDMV/projects/1). If you are interested in helping out, sure, create a pull request!

# Privacy Policy

Zhiyu Zhu built *Learn to Drive A-Z* as an Open Source app. Since I have no use with your data, I disabled every Firebase Analytics there exists to ensure nothing is collected. You can [download the source code](https://github.com/ApolloZhu/AZDMV) and run the app yourself to verify this claim. You should see something similar to:

```
